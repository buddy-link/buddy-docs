# Introduction

The BuddyLink SDK is an interface that provides simple
methods for interacting with our composable on-chain programs.

## Our Vision

We see a future where projects can reward users for helping them
grow. Web3 is about building a community that can work together and add
value to the overall network.

## Our Mission

We want to give people the smooth web3 experience they deserve.

By building composable and transparent infrastructure, we can enable growth and user
adoption by giving affiliates the tools they need to advertise for you.
